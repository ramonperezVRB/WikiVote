         "summary": "Pesticide Registration Enhancement Act of 2017  This bill amends the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act to revise requirements for pesticide registration applications and their corresponding pesticide maintenance fees and pesticide registration service fees. The bill: (1) extends the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to collect the annual fees for registering pesticides; (2) increases the maximum amount of registration fees, including the fees for small businesses; (3) extends a prohibition on the EPA levying other fees for registering pesticides; and (4) revises requirements concerning the use of the Pesticide Registration Fund, including by requiring the EPA to use a portion of the fund to develop guidance for product performance data requirements for certain invertebrate pests of significant public health or economic importance (e.g., bed bugs). The EPA must determine whether to grant experimental use permits for pesticides within specified time frames. The bill adds new categories of pesticide registration applicants who are subject to the registration service fees, such as applications for inert ingredients. The EPA must also identify opportunities for streamlining the review of applications to register a new active ingredient in a pesticide or a new use of a pesticide and for providing prompt feedback to applicants during the review process.",

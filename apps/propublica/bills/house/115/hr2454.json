DHS shall issue guidance for DHS employees authorized to access and contribute to the framework that enforces a duty to share between DHS offices and components for mission needs. DHS may exclude information that could:   jeopardize the protection of sources, methods, or activities;   compromise a criminal or national security investigation;   be inconsistent with the other federal laws or regulations; or   be duplicative or not serve an operational purpose.  DHS shall incorporate into such framework systems capabilities for auditing and ensuring the security of information.",

(Sec. 1) This bill directs the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to enter into an agreement or a contract with each state home to pay for adult day health care for a veteran eligible for, but not receiving, nursing home care. The veteran must need such care specifically for a service-connected disability or the veteran must have a service-connected disability rated 70% or more.  Payment under each agreement or contract between the VA and a state home must equal 65% of the payment that the VA would otherwise pay to the state home if the veteran were receiving nursing home care. Such payment constitutes full payment to the state home for such care.",

(Sec. 2) The bill makes the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) the primary payer (the VA is currently the secondary payer) for medical care relating to non-service connected disabilities and recovery of costs from third parties for certain care under the program.  (Sec. 3) The VA may share medical information with a non-VA entity (including private entities and other federal agencies) that provides veterans with hospital care or medical services. Such entity may not redisclose or use such information for a purpose other than that for which the disclosure was made.",

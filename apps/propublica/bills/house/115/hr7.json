         "summary": "(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.) No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act of 2017 TITLE I--PROHIBITING FEDERALLY FUNDED ABORTIONS (Sec. 101) This bill makes permanent the prohibition on the use of federal funds, including funds in the budget of the District of Columbia, for abortion or health coverage that includes abortion. The prohibitions in this bill, and current prohibitions, do not apply to abortions in cases of rape or incest, or where a physical condition endangers a woman's life unless an abortion is performed. Abortions may not be provided in a federal health care facility or by a federal employee. TITLE II--APPLICATION UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT (Sec. 201) This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to prohibit qualified health plans from including coverage for abortions. (Qualified health plans are sold on health insurance exchanges, are the only plans eligible for premium subsidies and small employer health insurance tax credits, and fulfill an individual's requirement to maintain minimum essential coverage.) Currently, qualified health plans may cover abortion, but the portion of the premium attributable to abortion coverage is not eligible for subsidies. (Sec. 202) The bill revises notification requirements for qualified health plans regarding abortion coverage and charges for abortion coverage.",

         "summary": "(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.) Women, Peace, and Security Act of 2017 (Sec. 3) This bill expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) the United States should be a global leader in promoting the participation of women in conflict prevention, management, and resolution and post-conflict relief and recovery efforts; and (2) the political participation and leadership of women in fragile environments, particularly during democratic transitions, is critical to sustaining democratic institutions. (Sec. 4) The bill declares that it shall be U.S. policy to promote the meaningful participation of women in all aspects of overseas conflict prevention, management, and resolution, and post-conflict relief and recovery efforts. (Sec. 5) The President, by one year after this bill's enactment and four years thereafter, shall submit to Congress and make public a Women, Peace, and Security Strategy, which shall:    be aligned with other countries' plans to improve the participation of women in peace and security processes, conflict prevention, peace building, and decision-making institutions;  include goals and evaluation plans to ensure strategy effectiveness; and  include a specific implementation plan from each relevant federal agency.   The President is urged to promote women's participation in conflict prevention, in coordination with international partners.  (Sec. 6) The Department of State and the Department of Defense (DOD) shall ensure that specified personnel receive training in conflict prevention, mitigation, and resolution and on other related topics. (Sec. 7) The State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) may establish guidelines for overseas U.S. personnel to consult with appropriate stakeholders regarding U.S. efforts to: (1) prevent, mitigate, or resolve violent conflict; and (2) enhance the success of mediation and negotiation processes by ensuring the meaningful participation of women.   The State Department is urged to work with international, regional, national, and local organizations to increase the participation of women in international peacekeeping operations. (Sec. 8) The State Department, in conjunction with USAID and DOD and within a year of the first submission of the strategy, shall brief Congress on existing, enhanced, or newly established training carried out pursuant to this bill. The President, within two years of the submission of each strategy, shall report to Congress regarding its implementation.",

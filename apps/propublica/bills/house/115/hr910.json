Such reports shall be deemed not to be \"offers\" under specified provisions of securities law, even if the broker or dealer participates in the registered offering of the investment fund's securities. In implementing the safe harbor, the SEC must prohibit a self-regulatory organization from maintaining or enforcing a rule that would prevent a member from: (1) publishing or distributing a covered investment fund research report solely because the member is also participating in a registered offering of the fund,Â or (2) participating in a registered offering of a covered investment fund solely because the member has published a research report about the fund. The bill restricts the SEC from conditioning the safe harbor upon specified requirements. ",

         "summary": "Designating Each Car's Automation Level Act or the DECAL Act  This bill requires the Department of Transportation (DOT) to:   complete research to determine the most cost effective method and terminology for informing consumers about the capabilities and limitations of each highly automated vehicle or each vehicle that performs partial driving automation; and determine whether such information includes terminology as defined by SAE International in Recommended Practice Report J3016 (published September 2016) or alternative terminology.  After completion of such research, DOT shall initiate a rulemaking proceeding to require manufacturers to inform consumers about such information. The bill defines: (1) a \"highly automated vehicle\" as a motor vehicle, other than a commercial motor vehicle, that is equipped with an automated driving system; and (2) an \"automated driving system\" as the hardware and software of a vehicle that are collectively capable of performing the entire dynamic driving task on a sustained basis, regardless of whether such system is limited to a specific operational design domain.",

         "summary": "(This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the House on March 15, 2017. The summary of that version is repeated here.) (Sec. 1) This bill provides that of the three members appointed to the Board of Directors of the Office of Compliance (OOC) to replace the three members whose terms expire in March 2017, one shall have a three-year term and two shall have a four-year term. (The OOC was established by the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 to administer and enforce that Act and to assist Members of Congress in understanding their rights and responsibilities under workplace and accessibility laws.)  The board members appointed to replace the two members whose terms expire in May 2017 shall each have a five-year term. This bill allows a board member whose term expires in: (1) March 2017 to be reappointed to serve one additional three or four-year term, and (2) May 2017 to be reappointed to serve an additional five-year term. Such board members may not be reappointed to any additional terms after their additional term expires. The bill amends the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 to: (1) permit a board member to serve after his or her term has expired until a successor has taken office; and (2) authorize the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Majority Leader of the Senate, and the Minority Leaders of the House and Senate to take such steps as they consider appropriate to ensure the timely appointment of board members consistent with such Act's requirements.",

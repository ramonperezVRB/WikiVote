         "summary": "No Sanctuary for Criminals Act This bill amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to prohibit any federal, state, or local government from prohibiting any government entity, official, or employee from complying with the immigration laws or cooperating with federal law enforcement of such laws. The bill expands the scope of law enforcement activities relating to immigration-related information that a federal, state, or local government may not restrict or prohibit.  A non-complying state or political subdivision shall not be eligible to receive specified grants and assistance, including Department of Justice or Department of Homeland Security (DHS) grants that are substantially related to law enforcement, terrorism, national security, immigration, or naturalization. DHS: (1) may decline to transfer an alien in its custody to a non-complying state or political subdivision regardless of whether the state or political subdivision has issued a writ or warrant; (2) may issue a detainer if it has probable cause to believe that an individual arrested by a federal, state, or local law enforcement official for an alleged violation of any criminal or motor vehicle law is inadmissible or deportable; and (3) shall not transfer an alien with a final order of removal to a non-complying state or political subdivision. The bill: (1) creates a private right of action for victims of murder, rape, or certain felony offenses; (2) expands the categories of offenses requiring mandatory detention; (3) provides immunity for a state or local government entity or official temporarily holding an alien in custody under color of federal authority; (4) provides that an alien may be detained, and a criminal alien shall be detained, without time limitation during the pendency of removal proceedings; and (5) restricts a detained alien's release on bond.

Such resolution characterizes Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem as illegal and demands cessation of settlement activities. Declares that:  any future measures taken in international or outside organizations to impose an agreement including the recognition of a Palestinian state will set back the cause of peace, harm the security of Israel, run counter to the enduring bipartisan consensus on strengthening the U.S.-Israel relationship, and weaken support for such organizations;  a sustainable peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians will come only through direct bilateral negotiations between the parties resulting in a Jewish, democratic state living next to a demilitarized Palestinian state in peace and security;  the United States should work to facilitate direct negotiations between the parties without preconditions toward a peace agreement; and  the U.S. government should oppose and veto future Security Council resolutions that seek to impose solutions to final status issues or that are one-sided and anti-Israel.

Taxpayers Right-To-Know Act (Sec. 2) This bill requires that the website of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) include a program inventory that identifies each program of the federal government for which there is more than $1 million in annual budget authority. Such inventory shall include: (1) any activity that is commonly referred to as a program by a federal agency, and (2) any activity that is referenced in law as a program after June 30, 2019.  For programs identified in such inventory for which there is more than $1 million and not more than $10 million in annual budget authority (smaller programs), the inventory must include:   an identification of the program activities that are aggregated, disaggregated, or consolidated as part of identifying programs;  for each such program activity, the amount of funding for the current fiscal year and the previous two fiscal years;  an identification of the statutes that authorize the program and any major regulations specific to the program;  a description of the individuals served by a program and beneficiaries who received financial assistance under a program for the most recent fiscal year; and  links to any evaluation, assessment, or program performance reviews by the agency, an Inspector General, or the Government Accountability Office released during the preceding five years.  For programs identified in such inventory for which there is more than $10 million in annual budget authority (larger programs), the inventory must include:  an identification of the program activities that are aggregated, disaggregated, or consolidated as part of identifying programs; for each program activity, the amount of funding for the current fiscal year and the previous two fiscal years;  an estimate of the amount of funding for the program;  an identification of the statutes that authorize the program and any major regulations specific to the program;  a description and estimate of the number of individuals served by a program and beneficiaries who received financial assistance under a program for the most recent fiscal year;  a description of the federal employees who administer the program and other individuals whose salary is paid in full or in part by the federal government through a grant, contract, cooperative agreement, or another form of financial award or assistance;  links to any evaluation, assessment, or program performance reviews by the agency, an Inspector General, or the Government Accountability Office released during the preceding five years; and  financial and other information for each program activity required to be reported under the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006.   The OMB shall: (1) archive and preserve the information included in the program inventory; and (2) not later than February 1 of each fiscal year, publish on a public website the total amount of undisbursed grant funding remaining in grant accounts for which the period of availability to the grantee has expired.  (Sec. 3) The bill requires the OMB, not later than June 30, 2018, to: (1) prescribe guidance to implement this Act, and (2) issue guidance to assist agencies in identifying how the program activities used in budget or appropriations accounts correspond with programs identified in the program inventory required by this Act. The OMB may: (1) issue guidance to agencies to ensure that programs are presented at a similar level of detail across agencies and are not duplicative or overlapping; (2) exempt from the requirements of this Act, based on an analysis of the costs of implementation, agencies that are not required to have a chief financial officer and that have not more than $10 million in budget authority; and (3) extend the Act's implementation deadline by not more than one year.  Implementation of the requirements in this bill must be completed not later than June 30, 2019. ",

If the biological implant tracking system is not operational within 180 days, the VA shall report to Congress explaining why the system is not operational each month until it is operational.  (Sec. 3) The bill prescribes requirements for vendors from which the VA may procure biological implants of human and non-human origin and for vendors from which the VA may procure biological implants of non-human origin. Such a vendor must: (1) use the standard identification system adopted or implemented by the VA under this Act; (2) be registered as required by FDA procedures; (3) consent to periodic VA inspections and audits regarding records and product handling; (4) agree to cooperate with all biological implant recalls conducted on the vendor's initiative, on the initiative of the original product manufacturer used by the vendor, or by FDA request or statutory order; (5) agree to notify the VA within 60 days of providing any adverse event report to the FDA or receiving any warning letter from the FDA; and (6) agree to retain all records associated with the procurement of a biological implant by the VA for at least 10 years.  The VA shall: (1) procure such implants under General Services Administration Federal Supply Schedules unless they are not available under such schedules, (2) accommodate reasonable vendor requests to undertake specified outreach efforts to educate VA medical professionals about the use and efficacy of implants, and (3) procure biological implants that are unavailable under such schedules using competitive procedures in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  Any VA procurement employee responsible for making a biological implant procurement transaction with intent to avoid, or with reckless disregard of, the requirements of this bill shall be ineligible to hold a certificate of appointment as a contracting officer or to serve as the representative of an ordering officer, contracting officer, or purchase card holder.  Certain biological implants may be temporarily procured by the VA without relabeling under the standard identification system. ",

Adopts the Rules of the House of Representatives for the 114th Congress as the Rules for the 115th Congress, with amendments. (Sec. 2) Directs the Sergeant-at-Arms to impose a fine against a Member, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner for use of an electronic device for still photography or for audio or visual recording or broadcasting in contravention of clause 5 of Rule XVII and any applicable Speaker of the House of Representatives' announced policy on electronic devices.  Prohibits a Member, Delegate, Resident Commissioner or a House officer or employee from engaging in disorderly or disruptive conduct in the chamber, including by:   intentionally obstructing or impeding the passage of others;  using an exhibit to impede, disrupt, or disturb House proceedings; and denying legislative instruments to others seeking to engage in legislative proceedings.  Amends current oversight plan requirements. Requires each standing committee, excluding the Committees on Appropriations, Ethics, and Rules, to adopt and submit to the Appropriations Committee, (in addition to the Oversight and Government Reform and House Administration Committees) by February 15 of the first session of a Congress an authorization and oversight plan (currently, oversight plan) for that Congress. Requires the plan's content to include:  a list of such programs or agencies with lapsed authorizations that received funding in the prior fiscal year or, in the case of a permanent authorization, that have not been subject to a comprehensive review by the committee in the prior three Congresses;  description of each such program or agency to be authorized in the current or next Congress;  a description of any oversight to support the authorization of each such program or agency in the current Congress; and recommendations for changes to existing law for moving it from mandatory funding to discretionary appropriations.  Authorizes the plan to include:  recommendations for consolidation or termination of such programs or agencies that are duplicative, unnecessary, or inconsistent with the appropriate federal roles and responsibilities; and recommendations for changes to existing law related to federal rules, regulations, statutes, and court decisions affecting them inconsistent with Congress's authorities under the U.S. Constitution.  Directs the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to report the authorization and oversight plans to the House by March 31 in the first session of a Congress. Requires the summary of a committee's activities' report submitted to the House by January 2 of each odd-numbered year to include its: (1) authorization and oversight plans, and (2) actions taken and recommendations made with respect to them. Prohibits an amendment to a general appropriation bill from being in order if the amendment proposes a net increase in the bill's level of budget authority.

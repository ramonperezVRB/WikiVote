         "summary": "(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.) (Sec. 2) This bill provides that the annual determination of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) staff shortages shall include shortages for five clinical and five non-clinical occupations for each network. (Such determination currently includes the five occupations for which there are the largest Department of Veterans Affairs [VA]-wide shortages.)  (Sec. 3) The bill establishes in the VA an executive management fellowship program to provide eligible employees of: (1) the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) and the VHA with private sector training and experience, and (2) a private-sector entity with VA training and experience.  The VA shall: (1) annually select between 18 and 30 eligible VHA and VBA employees and between 18 and 30 eligible private sector employees for such one-year fellowships, and (2) select such employees in a manner that reflects U.S. veteran demographics.  (Sec. 4) The VA shall conduct an annual performance plan for each political appointee that is similar to the plan conducted for VA career senior executive employees.  Each plan shall assess whether an appointee is meeting specified goals, including: (1) recruiting and retaining well-qualified individuals, and (2) motivating and developing employees for future VA leadership roles. (Sec. 5) Veterans federal employment preference provisions are amended to: (1) make all retired members of the armed forces preference eligible, and (2) provide preference eligible individuals with a senior executive position hiring preference. (Sec. 6) The VA may non-competitively appoint a qualified former employee to any VA position within the competitive or excepted service that is one grade higher than the position most recently occupied by the employee.  (Sec. 7) The VA shall: (1) establish a single database that lists each vacant VA position that is critical, difficult to fill, or both; and (2) in the case of a applicant not chosen for a position, and with his or her election, consider such person for other similar vacant positions.  (Sec. 8) The VA shall provide VA and VHA human resources professionals with employee recruitment and retention training.  (Sec. 9) The VA shall establish a promotional track system for employees who are technical experts to advance without being required to transition to management positions.  (Sec. 10) The Government Accountability Office shall conduct a study of succession planning at: (1) each VA medical facility, and (2) the VBA and the VA National Cemetery Administration. (Sec. 11) The VA shall: (1) collect information on hiring effectiveness, and (2) make such information available annually in a machine-readable format to allow for a comparison of hiring effectiveness by the Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) or a comparable public or private sector organization. (Sec. 12) The VA shall prescribe regulations to allow for excepted service appointments of qualifying students and recent graduates leading to career or career conditional employment.  (Sec. 13) The VA shall develop, in consultation with an appropriate non-VA entity, and carry out a standardized exit survey for career and noncareer VA employees and executives who voluntarily separate from the VA. Survey results shall be shared annually with directors and managers of VA and VISN facilities. ",

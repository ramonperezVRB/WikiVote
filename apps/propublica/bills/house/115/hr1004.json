An agency that communicated about a pending agency regulatory action during the previous fiscal year shall submit to each congressional committee with jurisdiction over the agency's activities, by January 15 of each year, a report indicating:   the number of pending agency regulatory actions the agency issued public communications about during that fiscal year,  the average number of public communications issued by the agency for each such action, and   the five pending actions with the highest number of public communications issued by the agency in that fiscal year and a copy of each such communication.

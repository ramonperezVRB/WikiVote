         "summary": "(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.) Cerros del Norte Conservation Act   (Sec. 3) This bill designates the Cerro del Yuta Wilderness (comprising approximately 13,420 acres) and Rio San Antonio Wilderness (comprising approximately 8,120 acres) within the Rio Grande del Norte National Monument in New Mexico as wilderness and as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System.   The bill sets forth requirements for the management of the wilderness areas regarding: (1) livestock grazing, (2) the creation of protective perimeters and buffer zones, and (3) the jurisdiction of the state of New Mexico respecting fish and wildlife located on public land in New Mexico.   The bill releases specified public land within the San Antonio Wilderness Study Area not designated as wilderness by this bill from further study for such a designation.   The bill requires the wilderness areas to be administered as components of the National Landscape Conservation System.   The bill withdraws any federal land within the wilderness areas, including any acquired land or interest, from: (1) entry, appropriation, or disposal under the public land laws; (2) location, entry, and patent under the mining laws; and (3) operation of the mineral leasing, mineral materials, and geothermal leasing laws.   The bill declares that nothing in this bill enlarges, diminishes, or otherwise modifies any treaty rights. ",

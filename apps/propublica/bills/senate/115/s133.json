         "summary": "(This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.) Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 TITLE I--INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES  (Sec. 101) This bill authorizes FY2017 appropriations for the conduct of intelligence and intelligence-related activities of:   the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI);  the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA);  the Department of Defense (DOD);  the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA);  the National Security Agency (NSA);  the Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force;  the U.S. Coast Guard;  the Departments of State, the Treasury, Energy, and Justice;  the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI);  the Drug Enforcement Administration;  the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO);  the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency; and  the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).   (Sec. 102) The amounts authorized, and the authorized personnel ceilings, are those in the classified Schedule of Authorizations, which shall be made available to the congressional appropriations committees and the President. (Sec. 103) The ODNI, if it provides prior notice to Congress, may authorize employment of civilian personnel in excess of the number authorized for FY2017 if necessary for the performance of important intelligence functions.  The ODNI must establish guidelines to govern the treatment under such authorized personnel levels of employment or assignment in: (1) a student or trainee program; (2) a reserve corps or as a reemployed annuitant; or (3) details, joint duty, or long-term, full-time training. (Sec. 104) The bill authorizes FY2017 appropriations for the Intelligence Community Management Account. Additional funds identified in the classified schedule for advanced research and development shall remain available until September 30, 2018. TITLE II--CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY RETIREMENT AND DISABILITY SYSTEM  (Sec. 201) This title authorizes FY2017 appropriations for the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability Fund. TITLE III--GENERAL INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY MATTERS  (Sec. 301) Appropriations authorized by this bill for salary, pay, retirement, and other benefits for federal employees may be increased by such additional or supplemental amounts as necessary for increases in such compensation or benefits authorized by law. (Sec. 302) Appropriations authorized by this bill shall not be deemed to constitute authority to conduct any intelligence activity not otherwise authorized by the Constitution or U.S. laws. (Sec. 303) The ODNI may participate in fund-raising events for nonprofit organizations that support: (1) surviving family members of deceased intelligence community employees; or (2) welfare, education, or recreation of intelligence community employees, former employees, or family members. It must notify Congress within seven days after engaging in such fund-raising. (Sec. 304) The ODNI must submit a five-year investment strategy for outreach and recruiting efforts in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) that includes cybersecurity and computer literacy. From FY2018 to FY2022, each element of the intelligence community must submit an annual investment plan that supports the ODNI's strategy along with the materials it submits as justification of its budget requests. (Sec. 305) Each element of the intelligence community may establish higher minimum rates of pay for positions that require STEM expertise.  (Sec. 306) The ODNI must implement a multisector workforce initiative to improve management of the intelligence community workforce and establish processes that enable the intelligence community to build and maintain an appropriate ratio of employees and core contractors.  Beginning on October 1, 2018: (1) personnel of the intelligence community must be managed solely on the basis of the workload required to carry out intelligence community functions and the funds made available for each such fiscal year; and (2) management of intelligence personnel shall not be subject to any constraint or limitation in terms of man years, end strength, full-time equivalent positions, or maximum number of employees. The ODNI must ensure that, during a fiscal year, there are employees in the number and with the combination of skills and qualifications necessary to carry out the functions for which funds are provided to the national intelligence program for that fiscal year. The ODNI must report to Congress on its methodology for calculating the number of civilian and contractor full-time equivalent positions in the intelligence community, its personnel cost analysis tools, and the plans of each element of the intelligence community to implement the multisector workforce initiative. The Inspector General of the Intelligence Community must report on the accuracy of such numbers and costs.  (Sec. 307) The ODNI must notify Congress of any project for the repair or modification of a facility for intelligence community personnel that has an estimated cost greater than $1 million.

The guidance for entertainment industry engagements shall not apply to routine inquiries made by the press or news media to the public affairs office of an element of the intelligence community. (Sec. 309) The ODNI must implement a uniform policy to ensure the independence of inspectors general of the intelligence community, the ODNI, the CIA, the NSA, the DIA, the NGA, and the NRO. The policy must: (1) prevent any conflict of interest in matters that inspectors general employees personally and substantially participated in during previous employment, and (2) ensure that personnel are free in fact and in appearance from personal, external, and organizational impairments to independence. The ODNI may not require employees of an inspector general office for an element of the intelligence community to rotate to a position in an office or organization in their element over which the office of inspector general exercises jurisdiction. Inspector general employees are exempt from a rotation that may impact their office's independence.

TITLE IV--MATTERS RELATING TO ELEMENTS OF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY Subtitle A--Office of the Director of National Intelligence (Sec. 401) The Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive is redesignated as the National Counterintelligence and Security Center with a director to be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate.  (Sec. 402) The National Security Act of 1947 is amended to require the ODNI to submit to Congress any analytic materials prepared for an investigation of proposed investments into the United States. If the investment will have an operational impact on the intelligence community, the ODNI must report on actions to mitigate such impact.  (Sec. 403) The ODNI must publish on a public website a list of all logos, symbols, and markings associated with foreign terrorist organizations.

(Sec. 422) The NRO shall develop a plan to carry out space-based environmental monitoring missions with acquisition programs to meet the national security requirements for cloud characterization and theater weather imagery. The plan must: (1) address the amount of funds that would be necessary to be transferred from the Air Force to the NRO during FY2018-FY2022 to carry out such plan, and (2) be submitted to Congress no later than July 1, 2017. The NRO may waive the requirement to develop such a plan if the Air Force is already carrying out an approved formal acquisition program that addresses DOD requirements for such activities. TITLE V--MATTERS RELATING TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES (Sec. 501) This title establishes an executive branch interagency committee to counter active measures by the Russian Federation to exert covert influence over peoples and governments (with the role of the Russian Federation hidden or not acknowledged publicly) through front groups, covert broadcasting, media manipulation, disinformation or forgeries, funding agents of influence, incitement, offensive counterintelligence, assassinations, or terrorist acts. The committee shall expose falsehoods, agents of influence, corruption, human rights abuses, terrorism, and assassinations carried out by the security services or political elites of the Russian Federation or their proxies. The committee must report annually on the steps it is taking to counter Russia's active covert influence measures.  (Sec. 502) The State Department must coordinate with the FBI and the ODNI to establish a mandatory advance notification regime governing all travel by accredited diplomatic and consular personnel of the Russian Federation in the United States.

(Sec. 503) The ODNI must conduct a study to determine the feasibility of creating an intelligence sharing arrangement and database to provide foreign countries that were parties to the Treaty on Open Skies on February 22, 2016 (except for the Russian Federation or the Republic of Belarus), with aerial imagery of the territories or other parties to the treaty that is comparable, delivered more frequently, and in equal or higher resolution than imagery available through the database established under the treaty. (The Treaty on Open Skies, done at Helsinki on March 24, 1992, and entered into force January 1, 2002, established a regime for unarmed aerial observation flights over the territories of other state party participants.) The ODNI's imagery sharing study must evaluate: (1) methods by which the United States could collect and provide imagery through commercial satellites, national technical means, or other intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance platforms under an information sharing arrangement; (2) the ability of other state parties to contribute to the arrangement; (3) statutory impediments or funding insufficiencies; (4) whether imagery of Moscow, Chechnya, the international border between Russia and Georgia, Kaliningrad, or the Republic of Belarus could be provided under such an arrangement; and (5) the costs of such an arrangement compared to the costs under the treaty for plane maintenance, aircraft fuel, crew expenses, mitigation measures necessary associated with Russian Federation overflights over the United States or other state parties, and new sensor development and acquisition. The ODNI must report on: (1) the extent to which Russian flights under the Open Skies Treaty contribute to the Russian Federation's war fighting doctrine, and (2) the Russian Federation's capability to exceed the imagery limits set forth in the treaty. TITLE VI--REPORTS AND OTHER MATTERS (Sec. 601) The ODNI must complete a declassification review of intelligence reports on the past terrorist activities of detainees transferred or released from U.S. Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
